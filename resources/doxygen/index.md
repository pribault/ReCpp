# Overview

Welcome to **ReCpp**, a sophisticated C++ library for reactive programming that builds on the [Reactive Streams standard](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) and leverages the [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/) model.

This library, powered by the [RsCpp](https://github.com/pribault/RsCpp) implementation of the Reactive Streams standard, empowers developers to create clean, concise, and efficient asynchronous and event-driven code with ease.

# Features

- **Reactive Streams Standard:** ReCpp is built on top of the RsCpp implementation of the Reactive Streams standard, providing a consistent and interoperable API for handling asynchronous data streams.

- **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP):** Embrace the paradigm of FRP to model complex asynchronous workflows with a clear and functional approach.

- **Comprehensive Operators:** Enjoy a rich set of operators inspired by the ReactiveX model, enabling effortless manipulation and transformation of data streams.

- **Backpressure Handling:** Efficiently manage backpressure to ensure your application remains responsive and scalable, even in high-load scenarios.

- **Extensibility:** Easily extend the library with your own custom operators or integrate it with existing codebases.
